# 🧠 Team Meeting Summarizer & Action Planner

Hi there! 👋

This is a personal project I built to help people (including myself) get more value out of their meetings. I noticed that after meetings, it’s easy to forget what was said or who was supposed to do what — so I created an AI tool to solve that.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This web app lets you:

- Upload a meeting transcript (or eventually, an audio file)
- Automatically get a summary of the meeting
- Extract action items (tasks, deadlines, and who’s responsible)
- View everything in a clean, simple dashboard

Soon, I’ll also add features to:
- Send reminders to teammates (via email or Slack)
- Store past meetings and search through them
- Transcribe audio meetings using Whisper or AssemblyAI

## 💡 Why I Built It

I wanted to work on a real-world problem using AI agents and language models like GROQ. This project gave me a chance to explore:
- How to structure prompts for summarizing and extracting tasks
- How to connect a frontend (Next.js) with AI (Groq API)
- How to organize a full-stack project that solves a practical problem

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Groq API via Next.js API Routes
- **Storage:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) 
- **Extras (coming soon):** Slack integration, audio transcription

## 📁 Features

- Upload `.txt` meeting files
- Instant summary with GPT-4
- Task & action item extraction
- Clean UI to view results
- Modular code that’s easy to expand

## 📌 Status

🧪 Still in progress — but core functionality works!

I’m continuing to improve the tool, and I’m also learning a lot about AI agent workflows along the way. Feel free to reach out if you’re working on something similar!

Thanks for checking out my project! 😄
